# Flutter Search

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Here I have Implemented two kinds of searches in Flutter.
### 1.By placing a text field above the listview (The data in the listview is returned from jsonplaceholder api).
### 2.By placing a icon in the Appbar by using SearchDelegate() class which is MaterialSearch.

If you want to see the difference switch between the DemoSearch() and HomePage() classes.
I have implemented this because there are only few resources to implement search.(Since they are using dymmy data in their app so I thought this could help some people).
